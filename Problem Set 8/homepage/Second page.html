                    Hello there! You've made it to the haven for dogs and all things dogs. Here we will talk about why dogs are the best and why you should be a dog person!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs for more reasons than one are better than cats because they actually like the person caring for them. As soon as you get home you see thier tail wagging as though
                    they have just seen a relative that they haven't seen in years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs also can see joy in the simplest things they do. Who else do you know can follow their tail for day on end loving every moment and every spin, no one.
                    Dogs will alwyas find a to put a smile on your face just by finding joy in any and all situations.
                </p>
