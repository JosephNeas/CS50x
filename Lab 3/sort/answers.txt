sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I know sort 1 is bubble sort because when looking at the reveresed txts bubble sort takes the longest because if has to rearragnge the entire txt one number at a time

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I know sort2 is merge sort because it is across the board the fastest sort with most files but especailly with the random txts

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: I know sort3 is selection sort because it is slower than both other sorts when looking at the sorted txt files hence meaning it its iterating over each number despite being already sorted
